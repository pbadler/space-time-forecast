  abstract   = {1.â€‚A change in a climate variable may alter a speciesâ€™ abundance
	not only through a direct effect on that speciesâ€™ vital rates,
	but also through â€˜indirectâ€™ effects mediated by species interactions.
	While recent work has highlighted cases in which indirect effects
	overwhelm the direct effects of climate, we lack robust generalizations
	to predict the strength of indirect effects. 2.â€‚For communities
	dominated by non-trophic interactions, we propose that the potential
	for indirect effects of climate change declines with the strength
	of stabilizing niche differences. 3.â€‚We tested this hypothesis
	by analysing an empirically parameterized four species population
	model. We quantified negative frequency dependence in population
	growth rates as a measure of stabilizing niche differences and projected
	the sensitivity of each species to direct and indirect effects of
	climate perturbations. 4.â€‚Consistent with our hypothesis, speciesâ€™
	sensitivities to indirect effects decreased rapidly with increasing
	stabilization by niche differences. 5.â€‚Synthesis. Information about
	niche differences can identify species sensitive to indirect effects
	of climate change and determine when multispecies forecasting approaches
	are necessary. However, practical application of this generalization
	will require methods to predict niche differences from easily collected
	data.},

  abstract = {Rapid climatic changes and increasing human influence at high elevations
	around the world will have profound impacts on mountain biodiversity.
	However, forecasts from statistical models (e.g. species distribution
	models) rarely consider that plant community changes could substantially
	lag behind climatic changes, hindering our ability to make temporally
	realistic projections for the coming century. Indeed, the magnitudes
	of lags, and the relative importance of the different factors giving
	rise to them, remain poorly understood. We review evidence for three
	types of lag: â€œdispersal lagsï¿½? affecting plant speciesâ€™ spread
	along elevational gradients, â€œestablishment lagsï¿½? following their
	arrival in recipient communities, and â€œextinction lagsï¿½? of resident
	species. Variation in lags is explained by variation among species
	in physiological and demographic responses, by effects of altered
	biotic interactions, and by aspects of the physical environment.
	Of these, altered biotic interactions could contribute substantially
	to establishment and extinction lags, yet impacts of biotic interactions
	on range dynamics are poorly understood. We develop a mechanistic
	community model to illustrate how species turnover in future communities
	might lag behind simple expectations based on speciesâ€™ range shifts
	with unlimited dispersal. The model shows a combined contribution
	of altered biotic interactions and dispersal lags to plant community
	turnover along an elevational gradient following climate warming.
	Our review and simulation support the view that accounting for disequilibrium
	range dynamics will be essential for realistic forecasts of patterns
	of biodiversity under climate change, with implications for the conservation
	of mountain species and the ecosystem functions they provide.},

	and the services they provide going to change in the future?ï¿½? and
	â€œHow do human decisions affect these trajectories?ï¿½? Answering
	these questions requires an ability to forecast ecological processes.
	Unfortunately, most ecological forecasts focus on centennial-scale
	climate responses, therefore neither meeting the needs of near-term
	(daily to decadal) environmental decision-making nor allowing comparison
	of specific, quantitative predictions to new observational data,
	one of the strongest tests of scientific theory. Near-term forecasts
	provide the opportunity to iteratively cycle between performing analyses
	and updating predictions in light of new evidence. This iterative
	process of gaining feedback, building experience, and correcting
	models and methods is critical for improving forecasts. Iterative,
	near-term forecasting will accelerate ecological research, make it
	more relevant to society, and inform sustainable decision-making
	under high uncertainty and adaptive management. Here, we identify
	the immediate scientific and societal needs, opportunities, and challenges
	for iterative near-term ecological forecasting. Over the past decade,
	data volume, variety, and accessibility have greatly increased, but
	challenges remain in interoperability, latency, and uncertainty quantification.
	Similarly, ecologists have made considerable advances in applying
	computational, informatic, and statistical methods, but opportunities
	exist for improving forecast-specific theory, methods, and cyberinfrastructure.
	Effective forecasting will also require changes in scientific training,
	culture, and institutions. The need to start forecasting is now;
	the time for making ecology more predictive is here, and learning
	by doing is the fastest route to drive the science forward.},

	that populations in warmer or wetter parts of a species' range should
	respond negatively to periods of above average temperature or precipitation,
	respectively, whereas populations in colder or drier areas should
	respond positively to periods of above average temperature or precipitation.
	To test this, we estimated the population sensitivity of a common
	shrub species, big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata), to annual climate
	variation across its range. Our analysis includes 8,175 observations
	of year-to-year change in sagebrush cover or production from 131
	monitoring sites in western North America. We coupled these observations
	with seasonal weather data for each site and analyzed the effects
	of spring through fall temperatures and fall through spring accumulated
	precipitation on annual changes in sagebrush abundance. Sensitivity
	to annual temperature variation supported our hypothesis: years with
	above average temperatures were beneficial to sagebrush in colder
	locations and detrimental to sagebrush in hotter locations. In contrast,
	sensitivity to precipitation did not change significantly across
	the distribution of sagebrush. This pattern of responses suggests
	that regional abundance of this species may be more limited by temperature
	than by precipitation. We also found important differences in how
	the ecologically distinct subspecies of sagebrush responded to the
	effects of precipitation and temperature. Our model predicts that
	a short-term temperature increase could produce an increase in sagebrush
	cover at the cold edge of its range and a decrease in cover at the
	warm edge of its range. This prediction is qualitatively consistent
	with predictions from species distribution models for sagebrush based
	on spatial occurrence data, but it provides new mechanistic insight

  abstract = {* In a rapidly changing world, ecology has the potential to move from
	empirical and conceptual stages to application and management issues.
	It is now possible to make large-scale predictions up to continental
	or global scales, ranging from the future distribution of biological
	diversity to changes in ecosystem functioning and services. With
	these recent developments, ecology has a historical opportunity to
	become a major actor in the development of a sustainable human society.
	With this opportunity, however, also comes an important responsibility
	in developing appropriate predictive models, correctly interpreting
	their outcomes and communicating their limitations. There is also
	a danger that predictions grow faster than our understanding of ecological
	systems, resulting in a gap between the scientists generating the
	predictions and stakeholders using them (conservation biologists,
	environmental managers, journalists, policymakers).
	
	
	* Here, we use the context provided by the current surge of ecological
	predictions on the future of biodiversity to clarify what prediction
	means, and to pinpoint the challenges that should be addressed in
	order to improve predictive ecological models and the way they are
	understood and used.
	
	
	* Synthesis and applications. Ecologists face several challenges to
	ensure the healthy development of an operational predictive ecological
	science: (i) clarity on the distinction between explanatory and anticipatory
	predictions; (ii) developing new theories at the interface between
	explanatory and anticipatory predictions; (iii) open data to test
	and validate predictions; (iv) making predictions operational; and
	(v) developing a genuine ethics of prediction.},

  abstract = {Forecasts of ecological dynamics in changing environments are increasingly
	important, and are available for a plethora of variables, such as
	species abundance and distribution, community structure and ecosystem
	processes. There is, however, a general absence of knowledge about
	how far into the future, or other dimensions (space, temperature,
	phylogenetic distance), useful ecological forecasts can be made,
	and about how features of ecological systems relate to these distances.
	The ecological forecast horizon is the dimensional distance for which
	useful forecasts can be made. Five case studies illustrate the influence
	of various sources of uncertainty (e.g. parameter uncertainty, environmental
	variation, demographic stochasticity and evolution), level of ecological
	organisation (e.g. population or community), and organismal properties
	(e.g. body size or number of trophic links) on temporal, spatial
	and phylogenetic forecast horizons. Insights from these case studies
	demonstrate that the ecological forecast horizon is a flexible and
	powerful tool for researching and communicating ecological predictability.
	It also has potential for motivating and guiding agenda setting for
	ecological forecasting research and development.},

  abstract = {* Rapid environmental change has generated growing interest in forecasts
	of future population trajectories. Traditional population models
	built with detailed demographic observations from one study site
	can address the impacts of environmental change at particular locations,
	but are difficult to scale up to the landscape and regional scales
	relevant to management decisions. An alternative is to build models
	using population-level data that are much easier to collect over
	broad spatial scales than individual-level data. However, it is unknown
	whether models built using population-level data adequately capture
	the effects of density-dependence and environmental forcing that
	are necessary to generate skillful forecasts.
	
	
	* Here, we test the consequences of aggregating individual responses
	when forecasting the population states (percent cover) and trajectories
	of four perennial grass species in a semi-arid grassland in Montana,
	USA. We parameterized two population models for each species, one
	based on individual-level data (survival, growth and recruitment)
	and one on population-level data (percent cover), and compared their
	forecasting accuracy and forecast horizons with and without the inclusion
	of climate covariates. For both models, we used Bayesian ridge regression
	to weight the influence of climate covariates for optimal prediction.
	
	
	* In the absence of climate effects, we found no significant difference
	between the forecast accuracy of models based on individual-level
	data and models based on population-level data. Climate effects were
	weak, but increased forecast accuracy for two species. Increases
	in accuracy with climate covariates were similar between model types.
	
	
	* In our case study, percent cover models generated forecasts as accurate
	as those from a demographic model. For the goal of forecasting, models
	based on aggregated individual-level data may offer a practical alternative
	to data-intensive demographic models. Long time series of percent
	cover data already exist for many plant species. Modelers should
	exploit these data to predict the impacts of environmental change.},

	in dispersal abilities. With high interspecific dispersal variance,
	the best dispersers tracked climate change, out-competed slower dispersers
	and caused their extinction. Overall, competition slowed the advance
	of colonists into newly suitable habitats, creating lags in climate
	tracking. We predict that climate change will most threaten communities
	of species that have narrow niches (e.g. tropics), vary in dispersal
	(most communities) and compete strongly. Current forecasts probably
	underestimate climate change impacts on biodiversity by neglecting

  abstract   = {Empirically derived species distributions models (SDMs) are increasingly
	relied upon to forecast species vulnerabilities to future climate
	change. However, many of the assumptions of SDMs may be violated
	when they are used to project species distributions across significant
	climate change events. In particular, SDM's in theory assume stable
	fundamental niches, but in practice, they assume stable realized
	niches. The assumption of a fixed realized niche relative to climate
	variables remains unlikely for various reasons, particularly if novel
	future climates open up currently unavailable portions of speciesâ€™
	fundamental niches. To demonstrate this effect, we compare the climate
	distributions for fossil-pollen data from 21 to 15 ka bp (relying
	on paleoclimate simulations) when communities and climates with no
	modern analog were common across North America to observed modern
	pollen assemblages. We test how well SDMs are able to project 20th
	century pollen-based taxon distributions with models calibrated using
	data from 21 to 15 ka. We find that taxa which were abundant in areas
	with no-analog late glacial climates, such as Fraxinus, Ostrya/Carpinus
	and Ulmus, substantially shifted their realized niches from the late
	glacial period to present. SDMs for these taxa had low predictive
	accuracy when projected to modern climates despite demonstrating
	high predictive accuracy for late glacial pollen distributions. For
	other taxa, e.g. Quercus, Picea, Pinus strobus, had relatively stable
	realized niches and models for these taxa tended to have higher predictive
	accuracy when projected to present. Our findings reinforce the point
	that a realized niche at any one time often represents only a subset
	of the climate conditions in which a taxon can persist. Projections
	from SDMs into future climate conditions that are based solely on
	contemporary realized distributions are potentially misleading for
	assessing the vulnerability of species to future climate change.},

Hierarchical Bayesian modelling provides a framework to make statistical inference and probabilistic forecasts, using mechanistic ecological models. To illustrate, we show how hierarchical Bayesian models of ecological diffusion can be implemented for large data sets that are distributed densely across space and time. The hierarchical Bayesian approach is used to understand and forecast the growth and geographic spread in the prevalence of chronic wasting disease in white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). We compare statistical inference and forecasts from our hierarchical Bayesian model to phenomenological regression-based methods that are commonly used to analyse spatial occurrence data. The mechanistic statistical model based on ecological diffusion led to important ecological insights, obviated a commonly ignored type of collinearity, and was the most accurate method for forecasting.},

The stronger the agreement from models that represent different processes and are based on distinct and independent sources of information, the greater the confidence we can have in their predictions. Evaluating the level of confidence is particularly important when predictions are used to guide conservation or restoration decisions. We used a multi-model approach to predict climate change impacts on big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata), the dominant plant species on roughly 43 million hectares in the western United States and a key resource for many endemic wildlife species. To evaluate the climate sensitivity of A. tridentata, we developed four predictive models, two based on empirically derived spatial and temporal relationships, and two that applied mechanistic approaches to simulate sagebrush recruitment and growth. This approach enabled us to produce an aggregate index of climate change vulnerability and uncertainty based on the level of agreement between models. Despite large differences in model structure, predictions of sagebrush response to climate change were largely consistent. Performance, as measured by change in cover, growth, or recruitment, was predicted to decrease at the warmest sites, but increase throughout the cooler portions of sagebrush's range. A sensitivity analysis indicated that sagebrush performance responds more strongly to changes in temperature than precipitation. Most of the uncertainty in model predictions reflected variation among the ecological models, raising questions about the reliability of forecasts based on a single modeling approach. Our results highlight the value of a multi-model approach in forecasting climate change impacts and uncertainties and should help land managers to maximize the value of conservation investments.},
